//! The SoundChex shell.
//!
//! Deliberately thin. The application is the Laravel server — this wraps it in
//! a native window so desktop and phone get a launcher icon, an app-switcher
//! entry, and storage that the browser will not evict. Everything the user
//! sees is served over HTTPS from the host in `tauri.conf.json`.
//!
//! Keeping it thin is the point: there is one frontend, already tested, and no
//! second implementation to drift out of step with it.

/// Boots the app. Shared by desktop (`main.rs`) and the mobile entrypoints.
